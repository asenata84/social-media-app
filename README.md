# React Assessment
Your task is to create a Facebook-like React app that allows the user to select favourite users(authors) and see their posts and posts comments.

The assessment uses the mock API at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.
The API provides data for users (posts authors), posts and post comments.
See `/src/api.js`.

## Main Tasks
1. Complete the implementation of `Authors.jsx` component that lists all the authors returned from `api.getAuthors` and allows the user to select favorite authors.
2. List the selected authors' posts in the Feed component by using the `Post.jsx` component.
3. On a click on `View post comments` button show the `PostComments.jsx` component with the comments for that post. Complete the implementation of the `PostComments.jsx` component so that it shows each comment name, body, email.

## Workflow
1. Create a branch from master with your name in it as following: `Exercise-Ivan-Ivanov`.
2. Do the exercise in your branch and commit in it whenever you think is appropriate.
3. At the end of the interview make sure you have pushed your changes to the remote repository.
